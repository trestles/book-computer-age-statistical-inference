## 4 Fisherian Inference and Maximum Likelihood Estimation
- Fisher's work held a central place in twentieth-century applied statistics, and some of it, particularly maximum likelihood estimation, has moved forcefully into the computer age. p38
### 4.1 Likelihood and Maximum Likelihood p38
- with theta being a scalar parameter of particular interest, such as the regression coefficient of an important covariate in a linear model. p39
- Less dominant now, for reasons we will be investigating in subsequent chapters, the MLE algorithm still has iconic status, being often the method of first choice in any novel situation. p39
- There is a downside to maximum likelihood estimation that remained nearly invisible in classical applications: it is dangerous to rely upon in problems involving large numbers of parameters. p41
